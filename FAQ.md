**How do I make a video ?**

Read more about this in the separate page [GeneratingAVideo](GeneratingAVideo.md) .

**Do I need the Processing IDE?**

> You don't. To run the trunk version of code\_swarm you only need java and ant.

> The original code\_swarm program was written in Processing and that's the form it was in when it was open sourced. It is kept in tags for historical reference.

**I get a compiler error about !java.util.PriorityQueue.**

> Upgrade your JDK to 1.5 or later.

**I get a stack dump when I try to load a moderate- to large-sized XML file. What's going on?**

> You need more heap memory. Do this by setting `-Xmx1000m` (one GB) as a VM argument (see run.sh).

**Why is there little to no documentation?**

> We're working on it.

**I've made a video using your software. Are there any restrictions on it?**

> Your videos are yours. However we would appreciate it if you add appropriate credits and link back to the project whenever you distribute your videos.

**Is code\_swarm open source?**

> Yes, under the [GNU General Public License version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).
